## About
I like to tinker with code, be it learning a new language, teaching my kiddo how to code with Lego robotics sets, or simply looking for ways to simplify and more concisely communicate with a machine. I love to refactor complex code (perhaps to a fault) into simple, elegant, modular code, leveragoing OOP and/or FP principles and design patterns. I first started coding in the early 90's writing boot scripts to selectively load drivers, etc. so that my 286 clone with sub-par RAM could run the video games I wanted to play, and as a result I have a keen eye towards software performance. Since then I have leveraged my coding skills to start an internal business process automation group for an environmental engineering firm, deliver exceptional new product and features for organizations from start-ups to fortune 500 companies.

I have led software teams since early 2017, and I love igniting a passion for clean code in others. Most recently I led the engineering team for a start-up, laying the groundwork for the eventual successful exit via acquisition by a fortune 500 company, and worked to seamlessly integrate that team into the new organization.
