## Narrative:
This project is still a work in progress. I originally developed this app using C# and Xamarin Forms. I built-out apps for both Android and iOS, and I recently started building a web app version using React. My goal is to connect them both the web and mobile versions using Firebase FireStore for realtime score keeping across devices. I have a prototype working using Realtime Database, but I want to get this working using latest tech (.Net Maui and FireStore) before publishing. 

## Scope:
- Configurable games
   - Win state (i.e. score goes to 0 or score goes to 100)
   - Starting scores
   - Number of players
- Ability to share your game with friends via link

## Roles:
- This is a personal project that I am working through on my own.
