#### Role: 
Program Manager, Solution Architect

#### Outcome:
Saved an estimated 4,000 labor hours in first year of pilot

#### Background:
Developed internal engineering design data management suite leveraging C# and MS SQL Server. Data was extracted from AutoCAD P&ID to a SQL Server DB, where it could be extended with the necessary data across engineering disciplines (Electrical, Instrumentation and Controls, Process Mechanical, Building Mechanical, and Structural). 

For this project, I designed the data flow architecture, database schema, and stored procedures. I managed a small dev team as player coach to develop C# applications and add-ins in various Autodesk products. 

#### Scope:
- Extract schematic design data from AutoCAD Plant3D/P&ID to be extended as needed by engineering
- Sync data to engineering deliverables such as specifications and asset data sheets
- Sync data between AutoCAD Plant3D/P&ID and Revit
