#### Role:
Program Manager, Solution Architect

#### Outcome:
Saved an estimated 10,000 labor hours annually

#### Background:
Led team of Revit content creators and software developers to built-out over 10,000 of highly configurable reusable components.

Environmental engineering construction projects tend to be very process and equipment heavy, and require a lot of complex specialized components with various configurations. By building out a flexible, parametric component library, engineers and designers were able to iterate quickly and deliver their design work much more efficiently. 

We leveraged agile processes, OOP principles, and test-driven development to build out the Revit families. This allowed us to re-use the more complex building blocks of the content to speed up the delivery of each subsequent component while ensuring quality. 

We also built a Revit add-in to more easily work the Revit content. Revit does not natively show users which parameters control which aspects of the content, and the environmental treatment equipment we is quite complex. The dimensioned cut sheets provided by the UI we developed allowed users to better understand and configure the content. This UI was connected to a SQL Server database to allow designers to pull pre-defined configurations to adhere to standards set by senior engineers. 

#### Scope:
- Library of re-usable and configurable parametric 3D content
- Database of standardized sizes and configurations
- Simplify configuration with Revit UI showing cut sheets that visually map parameters to associated dimensions
