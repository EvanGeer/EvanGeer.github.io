## Narrative:
This project involved taking a collection of nest modal dialogs and cleaning up user experience. This was one of the organizations earlier UIs and customers really struggled with the user experience, but at the same time, it was one of our more powerful productivity tools in our Revit add-in suite. 

My goal was to make the tool more user-friendly by providing visuals preview of expected results, and significantly reducing picks and clicks. 

## Scope:
- Refactor code in MVVM pattern to separate out and isolate the following:
   - UI Logic (View Model)
   - Settings (Data Model)

- Clean up UX to reduce clicks and user complexity
   - Visual preview for search results
   - Ability to run rules without closing the dialog
   - Undo/redo
- Add new functionality
   - Ability to add to or remove from current search
   - Zoom to selection
   - Isolate selection
