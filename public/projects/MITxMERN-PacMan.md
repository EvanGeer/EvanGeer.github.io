## Summary:
Simple project to demonstrate recursion and manipulating the DOM, while observing the state of the window. My 7-year-old son was the "Product Manager" on this project, and he came up with all the add-on scope. The project only called for the PacMan sprites to bounce off the edges of the screen with basic linear movement, but my son though they should fight Kirby and have more realistic physics. 

## Scope:
### Base Scope
- PacMan should change direction at screen extents
- PacMan should make a chomping animation

### Add-On Scope (extra-credit)
- Added Physics (vertical direction only)
   - Gravitational acceleration
   - Bounce losses
   - Randomized drag coefficient for each PacMan
- Resizing the window should scootch the PacMen back in the frame and retain the feel of their animation
- Single button should start the animation
- Formatting should be more visually pleasing
   - Button should be centered
   - PacMen should be visible behind the button
- Button should remain on top of the PacMen so that it can be clicked when they hover over"
