      <p>
        I like to tinker with code, be it learning a new language, teaching my
        kiddo how to code with Lego robotics sets, or simply looking for ways to
        simplify and more concisely communicate with a machine. I love to
        refactor complex code (perhaps to a fault) into simple, elegant, modular
        code, leveragoing OOP and/or FP principles and design patterns. I first
        started coding in the early 90's writing boot scripts to selectively
        load drivers, etc. so that my XT 286 clone with sub-par specs could run
        the video games I wanted to play, and as a result I have a keen eye
        towards software performance. Since then I have leveraged my coding
        skills to start an internal business process automation group for an
        environmental engineering firm, deliver exceptional new product and
        features for organizations from start-ups to fortune 500 companies.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have led software teams since early 2017, and I love igniting a
        passion for clean code in others. Most recently I led the engineering
        team for a start-up, laying the groundwork for the eventual successful
        exit via acquisition by a fortune 500 company, and worked to seamlessly
        integrate that team into the new organization.
