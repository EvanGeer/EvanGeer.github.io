## Narrative:
This project was part of the MITx Pro MERN Full Stack bootcamp. Our goal was to connect up to an API and query a large amount of data. We were required to build out pagination without use of a UI framework and implement that to navigate paginated results from our chosen API.

I chose to connect to OpenLibrary and Amazon to query book data and see what versions are available to purchase. Since this data is fairly static, the search functionality also caches search results per session to improve navigating back and forth between pages. 

## Scope:
### Base Scope: Query a Large Dataset
- Build an app that connects to an open API
- Query enough data to need pagination
- Build and implement a pagination system

### Add-On Scope (extra-credit)
- Added an additional query to Amazon to cross-reference availability and monetize links
- Added local caching of results to avoid re-querying

## Roles:
