### Product Manager, Solution Architect, 

## Narrative:
Developed internal engineering design data management suite leveraging C# and MS SQL Server. Data was extracted from AutoCAD P&ID to a SQL Server DB, where it could be extended with the necessary data across engineering disciplines (Electrical, Instrumentation and Controls, Process Mechanical, Building Mechanical, and Structural). 

For this project, I designed the data flow architecture, database schema, and stored procedures. I managed a small dev team as player coach to develop C# applications and add-ins in various Autodesk products. 

## Scope:
- Extra Data from schematic software (AutoCAD Plant 3D/P&ID) so that it can be extended as needed by engineering
- Sync this data to engineering deliverables such as specifications and asset data sheets
- Sync data between schematic software (AutoCAD P&ID) and 3D modeling software (Revit)
