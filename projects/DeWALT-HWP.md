#### Role:
Product Manager, Senior Software Engineer

#### Outcome:
- Extremely satisfied customer
- Additional contract
- Successful exit via acquisition

#### Background:
I led the team as a player-coach product manager. I worked directly with the client to define and refine scope. We worked in under an agile methodology, reporting changes in effort estimations quickly so that we scope could be refined or iterated upon. 

I also contributed to the project, helping to define the OOP architecture for the seismic placement, and clash detection potions. I also built-out the UI for the clash detection feature using an MVVM Pattern. 

This project was severely under-budgeted, but with my pro-active leadership and discussions with the client, we were able to refine the scope to something accomplishable within the allotted time-frame and with the given team. We effectively delivered on the 80/20 rule, producing 80% the value of the original scope in 20% of the effort. The PM for DeWALT described the project as the best software project he was ever involved with, and the parent company, Stanley Black and Decker was so pleased with the result, that it led to eventual acquisition, landing the developers on this project as the core team for Stanley Black and Decker's Construction Technology business unit.

#### Scope:
- Add support for Revit Fabrication Parts
- Add clash detection
- Add ability to place hangers by rules
- Add ability to place seismic constraints by rules
- Dramatically improve product performance
- Increase reliability
- Add multi-row edit across the application
