#### Role:
Co-Founder, Chief Architect, Full Stack Developer

#### Background:
BIMdexter is an end-to-end sheet management solution for Revit. If you have ever worked on a large-scale engineering and construction project, you are familiar with having thousands of sheets crafted over multiple Revit models and by large swaths of sub-consultants. BIMdexter allows you to centrally manage which sheets should end up in which models and track the status of those sheets as they are produced. 

#### Scope:
- Web interface to build a multi-model sheet index
- High configurability for data synchronization, sheet number configuration, and lookup values
- Map sheet list data to title block parameters in Revit
- Auto-generate a single index of drawings for drawings spread across multiple Revit models
