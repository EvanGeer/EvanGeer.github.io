## Narrative:
Working with a staff of Revit content creators and software developers, my team built-out a reusable content library of over 10,000 components. Environmental engineering construction projects tend to be very process and equipment heavy, and require a lot of complex specialized components with various configurations. By building out a flexible, parametric component library, engineers and designers were able to iterate quickly and deliver their design work much more efficiently. 

To build the 3d content, we leveraged agile processes, OOP principles, and test-driven development. This allowed us to re-use the more complex building blocks of the content to speed up the delivery of each subsequent component while ensuring quality. 

My team also developed a Revit add-in that allowed users to more easily work the Revit content. Since Revit does not natively show users which parameters control which aspects of the content, and the environmental treatment equipment we were modeling was quite complex, add visuals in the form of dimensioned cut sheets allowed users to better understand the equipment and more easily work with it. We also connected this form to a database to allow designers to pull pre-defined configurations to adhere to standards set by senior engineers. 

## Scope:
- Build a library of re-usable and configurable parametric 3D content
- Build a database of standardized sizes and configurations
- Simplify content usage by providing an easy to use form in Revit with cut sheets so that users can see which parameters control which dimensions
- Connect the content library to database of standardized sizes and configurations
