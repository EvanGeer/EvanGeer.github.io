## Narrative:
This project was part of the MITx Pro MERN Full Stack bootcamp. Our goal was to build a simple tic-tac-toe game to get used to using React Components. I extended the base functionality by allowing the game board and tiles to support other games such as connect four. I also added an AI element so that you can play against the computer.

## Scope:
### Base Scope: Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game
- Build a basic tic-tac-toe app 

### Add-On Scope (extra-credit)
- Added AI player
- Ensured that board and tile components would be extensible to other games
- Added Connect Four using those board and tile components

## Roles:
- Student
