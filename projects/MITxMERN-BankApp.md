#### Role:
Student, Full Stack Developer

#### Background:
This project was part of the MITx Pro MERN Full Stack bootcamp. Our goal was to create a front-end for a banking application that could handle simple tasks such as deposit and withdrawals. I also added Firebase Firestore to drop in a quick backend-as-a-service component and prototype its usage for future personal projects. The app allows for simple deposits and withdrawals complete with transaction tracking to provide a full banking statement. 

#### Scope:
##### Base Scope: Build a Banking App front end
- Should have basic login functionality emulation
   - no backend implementation, just username and password text validation
- Banking functionality
   - Deposit
   - Withdrawal
   - Statement (track all deposits and withdrawals)
- UI Features
   - Routing via Bootstrap navbar
   - Toast pop-ups for confirmations and notifications
   - Validation of withdrawals/deposits
##### Add-On Scope (extra-credit)
- Added Firebase backend:
    - fully functional authentication
    - storage of user/account data
    - Google federated login
- ATM-like UI
- Unit tests in Jest for most critical features
