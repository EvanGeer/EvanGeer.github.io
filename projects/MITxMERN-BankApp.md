## Narrative:
This project was part of the MITx Pro MERN Full Stack bootcamp. Our goal was to create a front-end for a banking application that could handle simple tasks such as deposit and withdrawals. The class offered started code, but I opted to build the app from scratch, so the software architecture and design here are my own. 

## Scope:
### Base Scope: Build a Banking App front end
- Should have basic login functionality emulation
   - no backend implementation, just username and password text validation
- Banking functionality
   - Deposit
   - Withdrawal
   - Statement (track all deposits and withdrawals)
- UI Features
   - Routing via Bootstrap navbar
   - Toast pop-ups for confirmations and notifications
   - Validation of withdrawals/deposits
### Add-on scope (extra-credit)
- Added Firebase backend:
    - fully functional authentication
    - storage of user/account data
    - Google federated login
- ATM-like UI
- Unit tests in Jest for most critical features
