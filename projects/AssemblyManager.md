#### Role:
Applicant, C#/Revit Add-in Developer

#### Outcome:
Successfully landed a new job!

#### Background:
This was a take home project for a job application several years ago. In this project, I structured the code to intentionally highlight my approach to Revit API work. 

In particular:
- IExternalCommand.Execute serves as a Procedural outline
- Each step in the procedure has its own dev command for integration testing
- Any functional logic is abstracted out so that it can be unit tested. 

I originally had 72 hours to turn the project around, but I have since expanded on the requirements and added some major enhancements to the UI.
